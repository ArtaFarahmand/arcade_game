## Instructions

This arcade game works in a very similar fashion to the classic frogger arcade game.

###### Goals/Winning Conditions

The goal of this game is very simple, the main character needs to move across the grey bricks towards the water without colliding with the bugs. Every time the player crosses the water without colliding the bugs they win. Every time the player collides with one of the bugs the game will restart. 

###### Game Controls

The player can move the character using the main up-right-left-down arrow keys on their keyboard.

* safari 

## Tools/Techniques
